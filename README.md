## This is a personal project I made for learning MERN stack by following a Tutorial

### Pre-Requisites

_Node JS_ & _MongoDB_

### Getting Started...

Run `npm install` in both _Frontend_ & _Backend_ folders.
Use `npm start` for running the _React JS_ app & `npm run local` for running Express JS app.

### Configurations

#### Frontend

You can configure the variables in `.env` file in the root folder to your choice.

#### Backend

You can configure the variables in `nodemon.json` file in root folder to your choice.

#### Extras

Additionally, create `uploads/images` & `public` folders in the root _Backend_ directory.
You'll also need the Google Maps & Google Maps Geo-Coding API keys to unlock the full functionality, but it can run as is.

_I'll be updating the project in the future.. Hopefully..._
